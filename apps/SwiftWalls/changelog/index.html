		     &bull; General: the entire app design has been redesigned and embraces the new style presented by Google called "Material You". The whole app undergoes a change in terms of UI & UX, all screens have been designed completely from scratch, offering a new look that is increasingly minimal and immediate. In particular, using Swift Walls on devices with large screens will be much more comfortable.
			 
			 <img src="res/screen9-1.png" style='max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%' alt="">
			 
             &bull; General: support for the new theme engine on Android 12 called "Monet". For all devices running Android 12, Swift Walls fully integrates this brand new theme engine. What is "Monet" and how does it work?
                    Monet is a new theme engine presented by Google with Android 12 and its primary goal is to offer, from my point of view, customization and consistency in apps. 
					The application colors (background, accent, cards and whatever is visible inside the apps) are generated by Android from the wallpaper. This means that each wallpaper set will generate a different color palette that will be used directly by Swift Walls, both for light and dark modes. As Swift Walls is a customization app, you will be able to choose and edit your wallpaper at the same time 
					(How? keep reading the changelog) in order to make the apps, which support this new theme engine, fit your style.<br><br>
                    To date, there are no official tools provided by Google for the adoption of the new "Material You" nor for the support of the new "Monet" theme engine. The implementation took some time and I hope you enjoy it.<br><br>
					
			<img src="res/screen9-2.png" style='max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%' alt="">
             					
			&bull; Functions: the section to customize your wallpaper has been redesigned from scratch on the functionality and design side. It's now all wrapped up in 2 buttons: reset and customize. The reset button allows you to revert to the original wallpaper, undoing changes made with filters or blur. The customize button is always the same, it contains the possibility to save the modified wallpaper, share it, 
			blur it or apply filters to it. Two new options are added to the customize button: "preview", to simulate a preview of the wallpaper changed in the launcher and "palette" (see next point).<br>
			&bull; Functions: redesigned from scratch the functionality to generate a palette of colors from the wallpaper. It is much faster and more accurate.<br>
			&bull; Functions: added a brand new widget (fully dynamic on Android 12 like the app itself)<br>
		        &bull; Functions: full support for Android 12 (API 31)<br>
		        &bull; Functions: wallpaper loading from the system is 30 times faster now<br>
		        &bull; Functions: added import support for editing wallpapers from categories (see below under "Showcase").<br><br>
			
			&bull; Showcase: added new categories of wallpapers based on the requests received: plants, vehicles, sea, amoled and finally sport. They include more than 250 carefully chosen new wallpapers. Warning: some of them will unlock in the following days with events (free of course) within the app.<br>
			
			<img src="res/screen9-3.png" style='max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%' alt="">
			
			&bull; Showcase: the display of the chosen wallpaper is immediate without wasting time. Now also here we find two options: "preview", to simulate a preview of the new wallpaper in the launcher (positioned in the same way as it is in the customization section in order to make it even clearer that it is the same functionality) and "edit", to import the wallpaper you have chosen within the customization section without turning around other apps or screens: 
			everything will happen automatically and you can, in a simple click, blur your next wallpaper, apply filters and much more. As usual, before applying it permanently, you can simulate it in the launcher.<br>
			
			<img src="res/screen9-4.png" style='max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%' alt="">
			
            &bull; Showcase: improved compression algorithm for users using the data saver option: compressed wallpapers weigh 15% less than before.<br><br>


			&bull; Settings: completely new and improved the speed with which the options are enabled/disabled.<br>
			&bull; Settings: the options to choose the accent color and pitch black theme have been temporarily removed. They will be back starting with the next updates. Why were they removed? they made the memory load too heavy on some devices leading to several crashes. 
			Right now I'm working on writing them all over again, trying to make them more efficient in terms of memory usage and performance.

            <img src="res/screen9-5.png" style='max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%' alt="">			

            &bull; UI: slightly updated the app icon colors.<br>
			&bull; UI: added suggestion cards for some features/sections when opening the app for the first time.<br>
			&bull; UI: changelog, FAQ and privacy policy section have been rewritten from scratch.<br>
			&bull; UI: lots of changes to discover.<br><br>
			

            &bull; Languages: Swift Walls is now partially translated into Portuguese, Indian and Spanish. In upcoming versions that are released, people who are translating the app into these new languages will finish the translations. Special thanks to all the volunteers who translate the new content from time to time and to all those who join in translating.<br><br>
			
            &bull; Bug fixes: finally fixed a bug (unfortunately not of Swift Walls but of OnePlus) that caused a crash on some OnePlus phones: now the customization section will be disabled when this happens. A guide will appear, as explanatory as possible, for how to make the customization section available.<br>
			&bull; Bug fixes: fixed several bugs that caused slowdowns on older devices or with underperforming processors.<br>
			&bull; Bug fixes: fixed the aspect ratio of the images in the customization section.<br>
			&bull; Bug fixes: improved the segmentation of the wallpaper when applying filters: on older devices there will be no slowdowns or excessive battery consumption as reported.<br>
			&bull; Bug fixes: fixed a bug that resulted in Swift Walls crashing when browsing wallpaper categories.<br>
			&bull; Bug fixes: fixed some lags caused by previous poor handling of images when they are loaded.<br>
			&bull; Bug fixes: fixed other bugs of lesser importance and most likely some have also been added :'D<br><br>
			
			
			&bull; Special thanks to all beta testers for the monstrous beta testing that helped me improve Swift Walls a lot with this release.<br>

                 This version includes changes that are hardly noticeable visually. Many bugs have been fixed, especially those reported by users. The preview mode has been slightly renewed, it now includes a notification that allows (I hope) to better understand how it works. The official telegram group is now available again under "About", feel free to join and participate, suggesting new features or reporting crashes / issues. For users who install the app for the first time, a small card will appear that will guide them to follow a video tutorial on how to use the app at its best. Finally, this update introduces a beautiful new icon designed and curated by Max Patchs.<br>
		  
		  <img src="res/banner.png" style='max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%' alt="New icon"><br>
		  
		  As the topic of privacy is very important in this period, I want to remind you, as you can read in the privacy policy of Swift Walls, that the app does not collect any type of data connected to you. In particular, the photos you import to Swift Walls for editing remain on your device and are absolutely not collected for sale, which other apps, much more popular than this one, do. The only data that is collected is information about your device (model, manufacturer, error log due to crash) and absolutely nothing else, as already explained above. Being a developer and a user at the same time, I really care about the transparency of the data in my apps. In summary, under "About" you can find both the privacy policy and the FAQ section in which, for the more curious, it is explained why certain permissions are used.

			         &bull; Functions: [only for logged in users] the possibility of uploading a wallpaper of your choice directly from your gallery via drive has been added, to be able to share it with other users after its approval. (the choice to use drive is due to the fact that swift walls will never insert subscriptions within its app, for this reason, I cannot maintain server-side costs that depend on the number of images uploaded)<br>
					 &bull; Functions: a data saver has finally been added: limit data usage on mobile networks &amp; WiFi by displaying wallpapers at a lower resolution. The option can be disabled under settings in advanced features, however if you don't have a particularly fast internet connection, leaving data saver on can greatly improve your user experience<br>
