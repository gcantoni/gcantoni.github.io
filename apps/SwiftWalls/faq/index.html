            <h3>Where are the wallpapers saved?</h3>
          </a>
          <p>The wallpapers are saved to the <b>/Pictures</b> path.
          </p>
        </li>

          <a href="#view-saved-wallpapers">
            <img src="res/arrow.svg">
            <h3>How can I view saved wallpapers?</h3>
          </a>
          <p>You can view the saved wallpapers through a common Gallery app or using a file manager.<br>Both those already present in the operating system and those of third parties are fine.</p>

            <img src="res/arrow.svg">
            <h3>Why are the wallpapers shown in the showcase of low quality?</h3>
          </a>
          <p>
             For exactly 3 reasons basically.<br>The first is to ensure fast loading.<br>The second is to avoid consuming too much data.<br>The third one (the one I consider most important) is to avoid making the cache too heavy. 
             Please note that although many wallpapers are loaded the app cache is not affected at all.

            <h3>Downloading a wallpaper takes too long. How to fix?</h3>
          </a>
          <p>The speed of downloading the wallpaper depends only on your internet provider.</p>

          <a href="#statistics-colors">

            <h3>The "Statistics" section doesn't show me all the wallpaper colors. Why?</h3>
          </a>
          <p>This depends on the complexity of the wallpaper and the presence of colors in it. If a wallpaper has two colors, it is impossible to find more than two colors on it and so on.</p>

            <h3>Why is access with the Google account required?</h3>
          </a>
          <p>Access through the Google Account is <b>optional.</b> As you can see for yourself, if you are not logged in you will be "anonymous".
              Swift Walls features will remain the same. However, connecting with an account allows you to get some advantages among which we find:
              if you purchased the pro version, it will also be remembered in your account and not only with the billing library and also the "featured" wallpapers will have a heart-shaped button. By clicking on it or not, you can let me know if you like them or not and based on this you will be periodically offered different wallpapers.
              Most likely, more account-related features will be added, be sure to check this page often.</p>

            <h3>How does uploading to Drive work?</h3>
          </a>
          <p>Uploading to Drive is very simple. It does not require an account logged into Swift Walls as this feature integrates with the Drive application installed on your phone. You will be able to upload as many modified and customized wallpapers as possible, as long as it does not exceed the limit offered by your Drive plan.</p>
